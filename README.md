## Features

This project includes several key sections to provide a comprehensive overview of the company's offerings:

* **Responsive Navigation Bar:** The navigation bar is designed to be fully responsive, with a classic horizontal menu on larger screens and a collapsible "hamburger" menu on smaller devices, powered by Bootstrap's JavaScript.
* **Hero Section:** A captivating hero section with a background image and a clear, concise headline to immediately grab the visitor's attention.
* **Services Section:** Highlights the key services offered, such as an interactive platform, doubt support, and customizable coding experiences, presented in a grid of cards.
* **Interactive Elements:** The project includes subtle animations and hover effects on service icons and buttons to create a more dynamic and engaging user experience.
* **About Us & Course List:** A dedicated section to introduce the company and provide a clear, organized list of available courses with details on duration, level, and instructor.
* **Dynamic Forms:** Two forms are included—one for creating a learning plan and another for general inquiries—to capture user information and encourage interaction.
* **Testimonials Carousel:** A responsive testimonial section using Bootstrap's carousel component to showcase student feedback. This is a great way to build credibility.
* **Contact Section:** Provides essential contact information and an embedded map for easy location, along with a dedicated inquiry form.
* **Aesthetics and Design:** The design uses a modern color palette with a vibrant primary color (`#ff511a`) and a secondary accent color (`#43ba7f`) to highlight key information. The layout is clean and easy to navigate.
